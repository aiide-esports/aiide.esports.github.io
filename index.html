  <h1 class="firsth1">WORKSHOP SUMMARY</h1>
  
  <p>Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and 1 
  billion US dollars in revenue each year. For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in 
  revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware 
  of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and 
  potential.</p>

  <p>The Esports and High Performance HCI (EHPHCI) workshop will begin addressing that research gap. In esports, athletes 
  compete through the computer interface. Because this interface can make the difference between winning and losing, esports 
  athletes are among the most expert computer interface users in the world, as other athletes are experts in using balls and 
  shoes in traditional sports. The premise of this workshop is that people will apply esports technology broadly, improving 
  performance in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, 
  design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.</p>

  <h1>WORKSHOP DATE AND ONLINE ACCESS</h1>
  
  <p>The EHPHCI workshop will be held online on Saturday May 8, as part of the <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/">ACM CHI 
  Conference</a>. The workshop will run from 1300 - 1800 UTC 
  (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210508T13">this site</a> shows your local time).</p> 
 
  <p>Workshop registration and attendance requires an access code. If you do not already have a code, you may email the 
  organizers to request one, but unfortunately, codes are limited. Registration costs $30, plus the cost of at least a one day 
  <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/register">registration for ACM CHI</a>. After registering, you may access the workshop
  through CHI's <a href="https://acmchi.delegateconnect.co/events/sessions/w29-esports-and-high-performance-hci">Delegate Connect 
  service</a>, which uses Zoom. In addition, we have created a workshop Discord server, which you may access using this

      <br/>
      <em>Bio:</em> Amine earned his doctorate at the Mayo Clinic researching the extremes of human performance, with his findings 
      powering development of technology in mobile health and remote monitoring. He also spent decades playing video games, 
      and competed professionally for a couple years. He came to believe that there are many broader lessons in performance 
      that can be learned from the arena of esports. He was able to channel both his performance and gaming passions to 
      found Mobalytics, a performance assessment and optimization platform for gamers.

  <h1>SUBMISSIONS</h1>

  <p>EHPHCI has two submission tracks: short papers (research, position or case study) and posters.</p>

  <h2>Short Research Papers</h2>
 
  <p>We invite submission of research papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. 
  Research papers will be reviewed based on how well claims are supported by evidence. Submissions are 
  expected to include all materials and data needed to replicate and reproduce any figures, analyses, 
  and methods. If anything cannot be publicly shared (e.g., for data privacy concerns), state the 
  reason in the paper.</p>

  <h2>Short Position Papers</h2>
 
  <p>We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. 
  Position papers are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and 
  ideas with regards to esports and high performance HCI research, and in particular the focus topic of 
  the workshop. Position papers will be selected according to their importance and relevance for the 
  workshop topics and how well they will fit the planned discussions.</p>

  <h2>Short Case Study Papers</h2>
 
  <p>We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. 
  Case study papers describe applications of esports and high performance HCI technology. Case study 
  papers will be selected by their match to workshop themes, and their likelihood to generate discussion.</p>

  <h2>Posters</h2>
 
  <p>We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area in the form of extended abstracts 1 
  to 2 pages in length (plus an additional page for references).</p>
