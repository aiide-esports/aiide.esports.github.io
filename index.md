## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

UPDATE: The Esports Analytics workshop will be running as a combined event with the Strategy Games Workshop. For more information please see: https://skatgame.net/mburo/aiide22ws/

Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and $1 billion US dollars in revenue each year. For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential.

The Esports Analytics Workshop will address that research gap. In esports, athletes compete and spectators view in a fully digital arena. This makes esports a unique opportunity for rich analysis of both expert computer users, and passionate online viewers. The knowledge gained from this analysis should apply broadly, improving active performance and passive experience in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.
