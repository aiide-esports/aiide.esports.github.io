# CALL FOR PAPERS

**Date and Location:** October 21 or 22, 2018 in Berlin, Germany

Visualization recently entered the mainstream, and is now a form of communication in news media, social networks and presentations. The VisComm workshop will bring together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address the questions raised by visualization’s new communicative role. To encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do not typically attend IEEE Visualization and write academic papers, VisComm seeks not only short papers but also visual case studies: one-page abstracts with video walkthroughs of communicative visualizations.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

VisComm seeks contributions addressing the following types of questions: 

- How should visualization adapt to the more diverse audience for communicative visualization, which varies in demographics, visualization literacy and more? 
- New communicative visualization applications are emerging, including behavioral challenges in health and sustainability. What other applications need visualization for presentation, and how should visualization change to serve them? 
- When is a communicative visualization successful, and how can new measures such as eye tracking and galvanic skin response help us gauge that success? 
- How can practitioners build visualizations that communicate successfully, and are there visualization techniques (perhaps “chart junk”) that are particularly effective in that role? 
- Are there models, possibly derived from theories of memory, metaphor or persuasion, that can guide and guide effective communicative visualization?

## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks: for papers and for posters.

### Papers

We invite research and position papers between 5 and 10 pages in length.  All submissions must be formatted according to the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (i.e., NOT the journal style template that full papers use).  Papers are to be submitted online through the Precision Conference System (additional details TBA).  All papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  All papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  If applicable, a link to a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The papers will be juried by the organizers and selected external reviewers and will be chosen according to relevance, quality, and likelihood that they will stimulate and contribute to the discussion. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register  for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
