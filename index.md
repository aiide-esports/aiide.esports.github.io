## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and $1 billion US dollars in revenue each year. For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential.

The Esports Analytics Workshop will address that research gap. In esports, athletes compete and spectators view in a fully digital arena. This makes esports a unique opportunity for rich analysis of both expert computer users, and passionate online viewers. The knowledge gained from this analysis should apply broadly, improving active performance and passive experience in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.

## WORKSHOP DATE AND REGISTRATION

The Esports Analytics Workshop will be held on October 25, as part of the [AAAI AIIDE Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/aiide-2022/program/workshops). Those who do not regularly attend the full AIIDE conference can [register for workshops only](https://sites.google.com/view/aiide-2022/registration).


## WORKSHOP TOPICS

The Esports Analytics Workshop seeks contributions addressing challenges and applications of esports analysis and technology including: 

- _Esports Agents:_ AI agents are a staple of esports research and development, whether intended as training partners or trained to play the game themselves. Advancing the state of the art can help these agents work more effectively as tools for training or playtesting.

- _Ethics and Transparency in Esports Data:_ As data-driven tools and AI for esports expand and advance, questions of ethical and transparent use of data have emerged. Balancing what is needed to advance technology and the games themselves with what players will or are comfortable sharing is an open question.

- _Esports Assistants:_ Esports suffer from steep learning curves. To address this, data-driven assistants ranging from AI to data visualization systems have been developed to help players improve more effectively.

- _Training:_ Effective training and team building methods are still emerging in esports. Esports innovations help athletes train more effectively, with contributions from sports science, medicine and psychology. Technical opportunities include deeply instrumented assessments and specialized training interfaces.

- _Communication and Collaboration:_ Remote team communication and collaboration are core to esports. The pandemic has changed the ways in which we work and educate, making esports' tested technologies, techniques and experience invaluable.  

- _Social Impacts:_ Esports technology supports athletes, organizers and fans. Esports faces challenges with its athletes, whose careers are often shortened by stress, injury, and rapid change. The public is also concerned about the effects of prolonged use of esports games and technology.

- _Expertise:_ Like esports athletes, knowledge workers use their tools for thousands of hours. Unlike esports athletes, most knowledge workers expertise quickly plateaus. New understanding of esports expertise might enable knowledge workers to improve their productivity.

- _Remote Operation:_ The current pandemic is accelerating the development of remote technologies such as drones and telemedicine. Expertise in gaming is a good predictor of success in remote operation, making esports technology a natural fit for remote applications. 

- _Rehabilitation and Adaptive Interfaces:_ An adaptive esports community made up of players with physical and cognitive differences is emerging. This not only levels the playing field for adaptive athletes, but also opens novel analytic frontiers for telerehabilitation.

- _Low Latency Systems:_ As in most sports, quick response times are a fundamental advantage in esports. Maximizing this advantage requires low-latency interactive software and hardware, with tightly integrated input, rendering and display components --- paired with low latency instrumentation and analysis.

We invite contributions from the esports industry, as well as a range of research disciplines, including computer science, electrical engineering, psychology, medicine and sports science.

## SUBMISSIONS

The Esports Analytic Workshop is currently accepting submissions as 1-2 page extended abstracts (with optional videos) receiving summary reviews. It has three submission tracks: research papers, practitioner papers, and software demos. All accepted submissions will be presented orally at the workshop, and published on the workshop website. 

### Short Research Papers

Research papers will be reviewed based on relevance to the esports community, and how well claims are supported by evidence.

### Short Practitioner Papers

Practitioner papers are articles by athletes, game developers, artists, and other practitioners addressing artificial intelligence and analytics in esports. They will be judged primarily based on relevance to the esports community, and the likelihood that they will generate discussion.

### Software Demos

Proposed software demos must be described in a written and (optional but encouraged) video form. We welcome works-in-progress, finished projects, and prototypes.

### Formatting and Submitting

Submissions for all three tracks should include a 1-2 page extended abstract, formatted as a PDF file using a 12-point font. Any accompanying videos should be 5 minutes or shorter in length, and uploaded to a publicly accessible website. Our review process is single-blind; please include author names.

SUBMIT VIA EMAIL TO THIS ADDRESS: <esportsanalytics-submissions@googlegroups.com>. Attach your PDF to the email, and include the URL of any video in the email text.

### Accepted Submissions

At least one author of each accepted submission must register for the workshop at the [AIIDE website](https://sites.google.com/view/aiide-2022/registration). Accepted abstracts will be presented orally at the workshop and published on the workshop website.
