## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

**Date and Location:** Sunday, October 21, 2018, 9-12:40pm, Paris Room at [IEEE VIS in Berlin](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome)

While visualization research is still largely focused on data analysis, most people experience visualization as communication and presentation. The _New York Times_ and other publications regularly release interactive visuals depicting complex datasets including political topics, budgets, and sports. An independent community of visualization practitioners and bloggers has also sprung up, producing and deconstructing visualizations of data of broad interest. Free visualization tools such as D3, Data Wrapper, Tableau Public, and others are available and widely used.

The VisComm workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address questions raised by visualization’s new communicative role. We encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do not typically attend [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/).

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

VisComm seeks contributions addressing questions including: 

- How should visualization adapt to its new, more diverse audience? Visualization for communication addresses an audience that is much more varied in demographics and literacy than visualization for analysis.
- When do visualizations communicate successfuly, and how can we measure that success? This might include web analytics, eye tracking, or even galvanic skin response.
- How can practitioners build visualizations that communicate successfully? Are there models that can guide effective communicative visualization, possibly derived from theories of aesthetics, memory, metaphor, or persuasion?
- Are there certain visualization techniques (like “chart junk”) that are particularly helpful for communication? How well do they work in concert?  
- What tools do practitioners need to help them build visualizations for communication? What are typical practioner workflows, and which parts of them are most challenging? 
- Which application areas are still emerging for communicative visualization, and how should visualization respond to them?

We particularly encourage contributors to address and illustrate issues like these with visual case studies that demonstrate the success or failure of communicative visualization projects in data journalism, public health and more. Our goal is to consider a broad range of examples and learn from their design decisions and process.

## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks: papers and posters.

### Short Papers

We invite submission of traditional research and position papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content.  Format submissions using the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (not the full paper journal style).  Submit papers online through the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc).  Accepted papers will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  Papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  Links to short videos (up to 5 minutes) may also be submitted.

The papers will be juried by the organizers and program committee, then chosen according to relevance, quality, and interest to attendees. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop, and present its contents. Registration information is available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/registration/conference-registration).
  
### Posters

We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area in the form of extended abstracts between 2 and 4 pages in length (including references), with an optional video.

We invite contributions from any discipline, but particularly encourage journalists and designers to submit their work involving data-based communication or reporting. Scientific contributions concerning visualization for communication are of course welcome, as well.

All submissions must be formatted according to the VGTC conference style template. Extended abstracts should be [submitted through this form](https://goo.gl/forms/PeG5TiTURGDl0BAA3). All abstracts should contain full author names and affiliations. If applicable, a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The abstracts will be juried by the organizers. At least one author of each accepted poster needs to register for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information is available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/registration/conference-registration).
