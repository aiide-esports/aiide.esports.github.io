# CALL FOR PAPERS

**Date and Location:** October 21 or 22, 2018 in Berlin, Germany

Visualization recently entered the mainstream, and is now a form of communication in news media, social networks and presentations. The VisComm workshop will bring together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address the questions raised by visualization’s new communicative role. To encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do not typically attend IEEE Visualization and write academic manuscripts, we seek not only short papers but also visual case studies: one-page abstracts with video walkthroughs of communicative visualizations.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

VisComm seeks contributions addressing the following types of questions: 

- How should visualization adapt to the more diverse audience for communicative visualization, which varies in demographics, visualization literacy and more? 
- New communicative visualization applications have emerged, including behavioral challenges in health and sustainability. How should visualization change to serve them?
- What applications are still emerging, and how might they shape communicative visualization?
- When is a communicative visualization successful, and how can new measures such as web analytics, eye tracking and galvanic skin response help us gauge that success? 
- How can practitioners build visualizations that communicate successfully, and are there visualization techniques (perhaps “chart junk”) that are particularly effective in that role? 
- Are there models, possibly derived from theories of aesthetics, memory, metaphor or persuasion, that can guide and guide effective communicative visualization?
- What sorts of tools do we need to help practitioners build communicative visualizations?

## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks: short papers and visual case studies.

### Short Papers

We invite submission of traditional research and position papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content.  Format submissions using the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (NOT the full paper journal style).  Submit papers online through the Precision Conference System (details TBA).  Accepted papers will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  Papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  Links to short videos (up to 5 min.) may also be submitted. The papers will be juried by the organizers and program committee, then chosen according to relevance, quality, and interest to attendees. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop, and present its contents. Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
  
### Visual Case Studies

We also invite submission of visual case studies, which are primarily audio-visual descriptions of compelling communicative visualizations. These case studies should describe the communicative message, the choices made in crafting the visualization to deliver that message, and how that visualization succeeded (or failed) in practice. Visual case studies consist of extended abstracts, and a mandatory accompanying video. Abstracts briefly introduce the case study, and should be formatted similarly to short papers (above), but be no more than one page in length.  Videos should carry the bulk of case study content, and consist largely of a walkthrough of the visualization illustrating its design choices, and their contributions to the visualization's success (or failure). Case study videos should be no more than 10 minutes in length. Both abstract and video should be submitted online through the Precision Conference System (additional details TBA). The organizers and program committee will evaluate the relevance, quality and anticipated attendee interest of submitted case studies.  All case studies accepted for presentation will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website. At least one author of each accepted visual case study must register for the workshop, and perform a live walkthrough of their visualization. Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
