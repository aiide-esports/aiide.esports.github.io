# CALL FOR PAPERS

**Date and Location:** October 21 or 22, 2018 in Berlin, Germany

Visualization recently entered the mainstream, and is now a form of communication in news media, social networks and presentations. The VisComm workshop will bring together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address the questions raised by visualization’s new communicative role. To encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do not typically attend IEEE Visualization and write academic papers, we seek not only papers but also visual case studies: one-page abstracts with video walkthroughs of communicative visualizations.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

VisComm seeks contributions addressing the following types of questions: 

- How should visualization adapt to the more diverse audience for communicative visualization, which varies in demographics, visualization literacy and more? 
- New communicative visualization applications have emerged, including behavioral challenges in health and sustainability. How should visualization change to serve them?
- What applications are still emerging, and how might they shape communicative visualization?
- When is a communicative visualization successful, and how can new measures such as eye tracking and galvanic skin response help us gauge that success? 
- How can practitioners build visualizations that communicate successfully, and are there visualization techniques (perhaps “chart junk”) that are particularly effective in that role? 
- Are there models, possibly derived from theories of aesthetics, memory, metaphor or persuasion, that can guide and guide effective communicative visualization?
- What sorts of tools do we need to help practitioners build communicative visualizations?

## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks: short papers and visual case studies.

### Papers

We invite research and position papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content.  Format submissions using the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (NOT the full paper journal style).  Submit papers online through the Precision Conference System (details TBA).  Accepted papers will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  Papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  Links to short videos (up to 5 min.) may also be submitted. The papers will be juried by the organizers and reviewers, then chosen according to relevance, quality, and interest to attendees. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
  
### Visual Case Studies

We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area from other research domains to submit extended abstracts between 2 and 4 pages in length.  All submissions must be formatted according to the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (i.e., NOT the journal style template that full papers use).  Extended abstracts are to be submitted online through the Precision Conference System (additional details TBA).  All abstracts accepted for presentation at the workshop will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  All abstracts should contain full author names and affiliations.  If applicable, a link to a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The abstracts will be juried by the organizers and selected external reviewers and will be chosen according to relevance, quality, and likelihood that they will stimulate and contribute to the discussion. At least one author of each accepted poster needs to register  for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
