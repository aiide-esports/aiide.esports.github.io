## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

**Date and Location:** The EHPHCI workshop will be held online on Saturday May 8. The workshop's times and details on how it can be accessed will appear soon. 

Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and 1 billion US dollars in revenue each year. For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential.

The Esports and High Performance HCI (EHPHCI) workshop will begin addressing that research gap. In esports, athletes compete through the computer interface. Because this interface can make the difference between winning and losing, esports athletes are among the most expert computer interface users in the world, as other athletes are experts in using balls and shoes in traditional sports. The premise of this workshop is that people will apply esports technology broadly, improving performance in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

EHPHCI seeks contributions addressing challenges and applications of esports technology including: 

- _Low Latency Systems:_ As in most sports, quick response times are a fundamental advantage in esports. Maximizing this advantage requires low-latency interactive software and hardware, with tightly integrated input, rendering and display components.

- _Expertise and Training:_ Effective training and team building/composition methodologies are still emerging in esports. Innovations in esports science help athletes train more effectively, with contributions from sports science, medicine and psychology. Technical opportunities include deeply instrumented assessments, analytics and biometrics, AI training partners, and specialized training interfaces.

- _Communication and Collaboration:_ Remote team communication and collaboration are core to esports. As the pandemic continues and it changes the ways in which we work and educate, esports' tested technologies, techniques and experience will prove invaluable.  

- _Social Impacts:_ Esports technology supports athletes, organizers and fans. Esports faces challenges with its athletes, whose careers are often shortened by stress, injury, and rapid change in esports games. The public is also concerned about the effects of prolonged use of esports games and technology.

- _Productivity:_ Like esports athletes, knowledge workers spend thousands of hours using their tools. Unlike esports athletes, most knowledge workers expertise quickly reaches a plateau. Emerging esports technologies and lessons supporting experts might enable knowledge workers to improve their productivity further. Such technologies might include task-salient visuals and overlays, low latency feedback, and tools for remote collaboration and teamwork.

- _Remote Operation:_ The current pandemic is accelerating the development of remote technologies such as drones and telemedicine. Expertise in gaming is a good predictor of success in remote operation, making esports technology a natural fit for remote applications. 

- _Rehabilitation and Adaptive Interfaces:_ An adaptive esports community made up of players with physical and cognitive differences is rapidly emerging, driving rapid enhancements in the availability of adaptive esports equipment. This not only levels the playing field for adaptive athletes, but also opens novel frontiers for telerehabilitation and telemedicine.

- _Research on Human Performance:_ Because its field of play is completely synthesized, professional esports test the limits of human performance constantly, creating new questions about, understanding of, and quantitative measurement equipment for performance and perceptual science. 

We invite contributions from the esports industry, as well as a range of research disciplines, including computer science, electrical engineering, psychology, medicine and sports science.

## SUBMISSIONS

EHPHCI has two submission tracks: short papers (research, position or case study) and posters.

### Short Research Papers

We invite submission of research papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. Research papers will be reviewed based on how well claims are supported by evidence. Submissions are expected to include all materials and data needed to replicate and reproduce any figures, analyses, and methods. If anything cannot be publicly shared (e.g., for data privacy concerns), state the reason in the paper.

### Short Position Papers

We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. Position papers are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and ideas with regards to esports and high performance HCI research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop. Position papers will be selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics and how well they will fit the planned discussions.

### Short Case Study Papers

We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 4 pages long, with length matching content. Case study papers describe applications of esports and high performance HCI technology. Case study papers will be selected by their match to workshop themes, and their likelihood to generate discussion.

### Posters

We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area in the form of extended abstracts 1 to 2 pages in length (plus an additional page for references).

### Formatting and Submitting

Your paper, abstract or write-up should take the form of a PDF file, formatted in the [ACM conference style](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (Use `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}` document type in LaTeX). You can read more about formatting recommendations on the [CHI submissions page](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/chi-publication-formats).

All submissions should contain full author names and affiliations. If applicable, a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. Submissions will be juried by the organizers. At least one author of each accepted submission must register for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information is available on the ACM CHI website.

SUBMIT VIA EMAIL TO THIS ADDRESS: <ehphci-submissions@googlegroups.com>. 

### Accepted Submissions

All accepted submissions will be published using links from the workshop website. 

<!-- Presenting authors can make use of a reduced registration fee at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/). -->
