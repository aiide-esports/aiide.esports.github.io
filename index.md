## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

UPDATE: The Esports Analytics workshop will be running as a combined event with the Strategy Games Workshop. For more information please see: https://skatgame.net/mburo/aiide22ws/

Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and $1 billion US dollars in revenue each year. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential. The goal of the esports analytics workshop is to begin to address this research gap, specifically looking at the research surrounding the use of esports data and AI. However, as this workshop has never before been run at AIIDE, for this first year, we are running in combination with the Strategy Games Workshop to help raise awareness and begin to build a community. As a part of the combined event, the Esports Analytics Workshop will being in an invited speaker and host an informal discussion regarding the future of the workshop.
