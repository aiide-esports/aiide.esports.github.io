## WORKSHOP SUMMARY

**Date and Location:** The workshop will be held on Sunday, October 20, 9am to 12:20pm at [IEEE VIS in Vancouver](http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome)

While visualization research is still largely focused on data analysis, most people experience visualization as communication and presentation. The _New York Times_ and other publications regularly release interactive visuals depicting complex datasets including political topics, budgets, and sports. An independent community of visualization practitioners and bloggers has also sprung up, producing and deconstructing visualizations of data of broad interest. Free visualization tools such as D3, Data Wrapper, Tableau Public, and others are available and widely used.

The VisComm workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address questions raised by visualization’s new communicative role. We encourage participation from journalists, designers and others that do not typically attend [IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org/).

## SUBMISSIONS

VisComm has four submission tracks: short papers (research or position), posters, and visual case studies.

### Short Research Papers

We invite submission of research papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content. Research papers will be reviewed based on how well claims are supported by evidence. Submissions are expected to include all materials and data needed to replicate and reproduce any figures, analyses, and methods. If anything cannot be publicly shared (e.g., for data privacy concerns), state the reason in the paper.

### Short Position Papers

We invite submission of position papers between 2 and 6 pages long, with length matching content. Position papers are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and ideas with regards to methods and methodologies for visualization research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop. Position papers will be selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics and how well they will fit the planned discussions.

### Posters

We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area in the form of extended abstracts one to two pages in length (plus an additional page for references), with an optional video.

### Visual Case Studies

We invite practitioners to submit a one-page write-up together with a link to an online piece or a short video. The write-up should explain what you made, why you made it, outcome/responses (both expected and unexpected), etc.

The goal is to show the work of journalists, designers, people working for governments or non-profits, etc., who use data to inform and communicate.

### Accepted Submissions

All accepted submissions will be hosted on the workshop website.

Authors of accepted papers will receive instructions to post papers on the Open Science Framework's [preprint archive](http://osf.io/preprints). Authors are welcome to post an initial version of their submission beforehand. Papers are not considered archival by IEEE.

Presenting authors can make use of a reduced registration fee at [IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org/).
